# .Rmd files
You can compile .Rmd files in Rstudio. Open them and click the "Knit PDF" button.
Note that you'll need a LaTeX distribution installed to do this.

#LatTeX Distributions
I recommend [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), which is available for all major operating systems.
NOTE: if installing on Linux, you can install either "vanilla" LaTeX from TUG or the TeXLive distribution your package manager provides.
If you do the latter, I recommend installing whatever the "full" version is.
It's a larger download, but well worth it in the long run.  

If you want an OS-specific TeX distribution, there is [MiKTex](www.miktex.org) for Windows and [MaCTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac.
