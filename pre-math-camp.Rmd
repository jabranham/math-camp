Welcome to the Department of Government at the University of Texas!
I'm looking forward to meeting everyone. I'll be your instructor for
Introduction to Math for Political Scientists, otherwise known as Math
Camp. In the past our incoming students have told us their math skills
are rusty and they would like to be better prepared for the Stats I
class that is required of all Government Department graduate students.
Math Camp will give you an opportunity to brush up on your
quantitative skills, provide an introduction to some of the
statistical software you'll be using next year, and is great chance to
get to know your fellow first-year students.

This year, we're meeting August 15th through the 23rd. Classes
at UT start August 24th. There is a full (tentative) schedule for the
class [on the class's website](https://jabranham.com/math-camp). 

Here is a checklist of items that you should review before your
arrival:

* Review what math knowledge is assumed 
    + Complete the exercises in that section to refresh your memory if
      needed 
* Install R and an editor on your computer
  [instructions](https://jabranham.com/math-camp/README.html#programs-you-may-want-to-install) 
    + Complete the exercises below to get acquainted with R

# Assumed math knowledge 

Students come to the department with a wide range of comfort with and
exposure to math. I assume a very minimal exposure to math, certainly
nothing beyond what was on the GRE. The following material is
knowledge that I assume you are familiar with. 

## Arithmetic

### Arithmetic exercises

## Basic algebra

### Algebra exercises

## Basic geometry

### Geometry exercises 

# Programs 

If you have a personal laptop, please install R and an
editor (RStudio is the most popular in the department). R is free and
open-source software. Installation of both programs is simple;
instructions are on the class website. Please email me if you run into
any problems.
