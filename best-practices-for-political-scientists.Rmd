# A Quick Overview...
1. Write using plain text
2. Code well
3. Use a version control system

# Write using plain text!
* What if we write an article now that gets famous?
* 20 years later, some grad student wants to extend our work
* How did we make Figure 1?
* Non-plain text files may be unusable 20 years from now
* Word processors (like MS Word) are [stupid and inefficient](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html)

# Code well - DO NOT CLICK A MOUSE
* All results should be replicable from a source file
* These source files (for example, .R for R scripts or .do for Stat do-files) should be liberally commented
* Comments explain what you are doing to your future self, collaborators, and others

# Comment example
```
# This code creates Fig 1
# I use the mtcars dataset (included with R)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") # Adds OLS line with SEs
ggsave("fig/fig1.pdf")
```
* Save this code snippit as `fig1.R` (or similar)

# Literate programming and reproducible research
* Previous example - have two files for one plot in a paper
    + The paper itself (document.tex or similar)
    + the script to create the figure (fig1.R or similar)
* What if we could combine these to have everything in one easy-to-read file?
    + This is what literate programming is all about!

# Literate programming example (using `knitr`)

```
\begin{section}
This is an example paragraph, written in \LaTeX.
Using knitr, we can include R code in the following manner.
I can reference the figure number by calling ref:
Figure \ref{fig:mpg-and-weight}.
% NTS - updating that figure with squared x doesn't change it
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig1plot>>=  # Starts R code, labels it `fig1plot`
# I use the mtcars dataset (included with R)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") # Adds OLS line with SEs
@ % closes R code
\caption{Miles per gallon and weight}
\label{fig:mpg-and-weight}
\end{figure}
```

# Version Control
* **YOU NEED TO USE VERSION CONTROL!!!!!**
* This can be as simple as putting things in Dropbox, which enables you to recover previous file versions automatically
* Word's "track changes" feature...

# Pathologies of the Dropbox/Word approach:
* Assumes they're both going to be around (in the same form(ish)) in the future
    + Remember computers 20 years ago???
* Word is expensive; not everyone has it
* You can "clobber" work (save over good work)
* Must tell coauthors not to touch files while you're working on them
    + Though this may be changing...
* Word conflates two parts of creating a paper:
    + Writing the actual document
    + Typesetting
    + We want to only focus on the latter (especially in the early stages!)
* You also tend to end up with many versions of the same project
    + ((show example paper))


# Git
* Git is a formal *distributed version control system*
    + There are others (Subversion and Mercurial are the big two), but we're going to focus on git
* It is an easy way to keep track of all the revisions you have saved
* It enables easy collaborating between many different people, without the need to email files back and forth or tell them when you're working on something
* You only have *one* version of a file at any one time
* You can see the entire history of a file easily
* You can see exactly what changed in each new commit
* There are *many* different GUIs so you don't have to deal with the command line
    + I like Sourcetree (for Windows) and SmartGit (for Linux)
    + Rstudio can also do most things 
* ((show example git history))

# Github
* Github is the most popular online git service
    + There are many others, such as BitBucket
* Each project gets a repository ("repo")
* Each repo is version-controlled (using git)
* Default is open-source (public)
* You can make repos private (for a fee - students get 5 for free)
* This file is a part of my "math-camp" repo [here](www.github.com/jabranham/math-camp)
    + Feel free to fork-edit-pull request any changes!
    + I included the PDFs, which is unusual since they aren't plain text

# Bonus best practice - Test your code!
* If you write your own function, it is important to test it to make sure it does what you want it to do!
```{r}
my_mean <- function(dat){
  the_sum <- numeric()
  N <- length(dat)
  for (i in 1:N){
    if(i==1){the_sum <- dat[1]}
    else{
    the_sum <- the_sum * dat[i]
  }}
  my_mean <- the_sum / N
  my_mean
}
mean_of_zero <- c(-2, -1, 1, 2)
my_mean(mean_of_zero)
```
