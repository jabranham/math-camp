1. Consider a problem in which you are rolling two dice.
    1. Create a set $A$ consisting of all the outcomes from rolling the dice where the sum is equal to 5. (hint: an element will be an ordered pair like $(1,2)$).
    2. Use set notation to denote the size of $A$. 
    3. Use set notation to denote whether $(3,1)$ is in $A$ or not
    
2. Consider the following sets and find the following:
$$P = \left\{ \text{UT GOV faculty members} \right\} \qquad n(P) = 70$$
$$T = \left\{ \text{ UT GOV faculty with tenure} \right\} \qquad n(T) = 35$$
$$F = \left\{ \text{Female UT GOV faculty members} \right\} \qquad n(F) = 15$$
$$M = \left\{ \text{Male UT GOV faculty members} \right\} \qquad n(M) = 55$$
$$X = \left\{ \text{Female UT GOV faculty members with tenure} \right\} \qquad n(X) = 10$$
$$Y = \left\{ \text{Male UT GOV faculty members with tenure} \right\} \qquad n(Y) = 25$$
    1. $n(T \cap M)$
    2. $n(F \cup M)$
    3. $n(T \cap M)$
    4. $n(F \cup T)$
    5. $F^C \cup F$ - to which set is this equivalent? 
    6. $X \cup Y$ - to which set is this equivalent? 

3. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two sets, where $n(X) =14$ and $n(Y) =25$. If there are twice as many objects in $X \cup Y$ as there are in $X \cap Y$, how many objects are in *both* $X$ and $Y$?
