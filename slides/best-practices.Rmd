# Intro
### Welcome to grad school
* We're going to talk about things that aren't taught or talked about very often
* How are you going to organize and manage your work?
* Academic writing is messy
    + Keep track of the paper, figures, tables, references, cross-references, analysis, appendix, etc

### 
* You want a system that keeps a record of your actions as you:
    + Edit text
    + Analyze data
    + Present results
    + Do the above *reproducibly* 
* We'll focus on free, open-source tools that enable this behavior and work on Linux, Mac, and Windows

# Record
### Version control
* You can use **version control** to keep track of changes to a file/folder/project
* The best version control systems let you easily see what has changed, when it changed, and who changed it
    + Word's "track changes" feature on steroids
* Gets rid of `paper.doc`, `paper2.doc`, `paper-commented.doc`, `paper-FINAL.doc`, `paper-FINALFINAL.doc`
* git is the best version-control system - it combines the benefits of "track changes" with that of backups

### Git
* Git is a formal *distributed version control system*
* It is an easy way to keep track of all the revisions you have saved
* You only have *one* version of a file at any one time
* You can see the entire history of a file easily
* You can see exactly what changed in each new commit
* There are *many* different GUIs so you don't have to deal with the command line
    + Rstudio can also do most things 
* ((show example git history))

### Why use git?
* Makes it easy to collaborate - no emailing files back and forth, no need to send an email so that you don't clobber coauthor's changes in dropbox
* But mainly for yourself!
* You'll generate a documented record of your actions that is also a backup of your project (dissertation?) at every stage of development
* When you return to your code six months from now, you won't have to wonder what it is or what you were thinking 

### Github
* Github is the most popular online git service
    + There are many others, such as Gitlab
* Each project gets a repository ("repo")
* Each repo is version-controlled (using git)
* Default is open-source (public)
* You can make repos private (for a fee - students for free, though)
* This file is a part of my "math-camp" repo [here](https://github.com/jabranham/math-camp)
    + Feel free to fork-edit-pull request any changes!

# Edit text
## Plain text
### Write using plain text!
* What if we write an article now that gets famous?
* 20 years later, some grad student wants to extend our work
* How did we make Figure 1?
* Non-plain text files may be unusable 20 years from now
* Bonus: plain text files are usually *much* smaller than their Word/pdf counterparts

### Editor
* If you write using plain text, you'll want an editor
* I recommend emacs, but it can be a hassle to get set up
    + Working with R use ESS, rmarkdown use poly-mode
* Other alternatives:
    + Sublime Text
    + Vim
    + RStudio (for R analysis)

### Markdown

``` 
# Markdown 

You can use markdown to write plain text that
[contain links](https://google.com). Markdown can also manage your
references and bibliography [@wlezien1995].

```

### Markdown - math
```

As a quick aside, we can also write really nice math in markdown.
Inline math goes between single dollar signs: ($\beta = 3$) and
display math uses double dollar signs:

$$\frac{1}{3} x = \pi$$
```
# Reproduce
### Reproducible research
* It's hard to reproduce a lot of research
* You'll sometimes have to modify a table in a paper months (years) later due to a reviewer or whatever
* How did you produce that figure/table the first time?
* Solution: Integrate code and paper with rmarkdown

### Rmarkdown
Rmarkdown lets you put code inside your markdown document like so:

    `r ''````{r}
    x <- c(1, 2, 3)
    mean(x)
    ```
### Overview
* Run data analysis in R, write with r/markdown, track with git, etc
* It's complicated but
* Everything is free
* Everything is open-source and runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows
* Your work can be done in a portable, documented, reproducible way
* These programs work well with each other
