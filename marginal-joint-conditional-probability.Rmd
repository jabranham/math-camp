# Marginal probability
* The $Pr$ of an event occurring:
    + $Pr(A)$
* Unconditional probability
* Probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck:
$$Pr(red) = \dfrac{1}{2}$$

# Joint probability
* The probability of both $A$ **and** $B$
    + $Pr(A, B)$
* This is the intersection  of the two sets
* $Pr(A \cap B)$
    + Probability of drawing a red card and a 4:
    + $Pr(red, 4) = \dfrac{2}{52} = \dfrac{1}{26}$

# Conditional probability
* The probability of some event happening **given** some other event having occurred
    + $Pr(A|B)$
* You've drawn a red card. What's the probability it's a four?
    +$Pr(4 | red) = \dfrac{2}{13}$

# How to convert marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities
$$
Pr(A|B) = \dfrac{Pr(A,B)}{Pr(B)}
$$
* The conditional probability is equal to the joint probability over the probability of the condition 

# Bayes' Law (Theorem)
$$
Pr(A|B) = \dfrac{Pr(B|A) Pr(A)}{Pr(B)} = \dfrac{Pr(B|A) Pr(A)}{Pr(B|A)Pr(A) + Pr(B|\neg A) Pr(\neg A)}
$$

# Bayes Example
* Police set up roadblock to randomly screen for potentially drunk drivers
* Person stopped and fails breathalyzer test
    + Test gives positive 98 percent of the time when person is drunk
    + Also gives positive 5 percent of the time when the person is actually sober 
    + We think that 1 percent of people going through the checkpoint are drunk 
* What is the probability that the man was actually drunk? 

# DWI Example
* Since he's randomly stopped, we think there is a 1 percent change he's drunk 
    + $Pr(drunk) = 0.01$
* Test accuracy:
    + $Pr(positive | drunk) = 0.98$
    + $Pr(positive | \neg drunk) = 0.05$
* Want to know:
    + $Pr(drunk | positive) = \dfrac{Pr(drunk) Pr(positive | drunk)}{Pr(positive)}$
* Everything known, except $Pr(positive)$
