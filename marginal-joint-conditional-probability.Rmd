# Marginal probability
* The $Pr$ of an event occuring:
    + $Pr(A)$
* Unconditional probability
* Probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck:
$$Pr(red) = \dfrac{1}{2}$$

# Joint probability
* The probability of both $A$ **and** $B$
    + $Pr(A, B)$
* This is the intersection  of the two sets
* $Pr(A \cap B)$
    + Probability of drawing a red card and a 4:
    + $Pr(red, 4) = \dfrac{2}{52} = \dfrac{1}{26}$

# Conditional probability
* The probability of some event happening **given** some other event having occured
    + $Pr(A|B)$
* You've drawn a red card. What's the probability it's a four?
    +$Pr(4 | red) = \dfrac{2}{13}$

# How to convert marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities
$$
Pr(A|B) = \dfrac{Pr(A,B)}{Pr(B)}
$$

# Bayes' Law (Theorem)
$$
Pr(A|B) = \dfrac{Pr(B|A) Pr(A)}{Pr(B)} = \dfrac{Pr(B|A) Pr(A)}{Pr(B|A)Pr(A) + Pr(B|\neg A) Pr(\neg A)}
$$
